# SEBF-encryption
Safe Encryption Based File is an encryption program I made to protect your data (like a secret diary or a your password). I want you to test it and enjoy it and please let me know if there are issues or improvment I can make in my code!
# Installation: 
after you compile the program in visual studio, you need to run, at least once, the program as administrator. Open it again and it'll works fine.
Enjoy it!
I've loaded the folder with the program alredy compiled (you will see 3 .exe files witch integrate in a better way the program with windows). Again you need to run the main file "Safe Encryption Based File.exe" as adiministrator at least once. Than if you right click on a .txt file and chose open with you will see crypter.exe. And if you double click on a .sebf file it will open the decrypter.exe.
Enjoy it!
# Curiosity:
I named the program Safe Encryption Based File because my name is Seby and my last name starts with F... so SEBF! Great stuff!
