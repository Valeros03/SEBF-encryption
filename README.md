# SEBF-encryption
Safe Encryption Based File is an encryption program I made to protect your data (like a secret diary or a your passwords file). I want you to test it and enjoy it and please let me know if there are issues or improvment I can make in my code! I'm Italian so some comments are wtritten in italian, I'm sorry for that, I hope you'll understand.
If you have any doubts don't esitate to contact me!
# Installation: 
After you compile the program in visual studio using C++20, you need to run, at least once, the program as administrator. Open it again and it'll works fine.
Enjoy it!
I've uploaded the .rar file with the program alredy compiled (you will see 3 .exe files witch integrate in a better way the program with windows). Again you need to run the main file "Safe Encryption Based File.exe" as adiministrator at least once. Than if you right click on a .txt file and chose open with you will see crypter.exe. And if you double click on a .sebf file it will open the decrypter.exe.
Enjoy it!
# Curiosity:
I named the program Safe Encryption Based File because my name is Seby and my last name starts with F... so SEBF! Great stuff!
